This project is a fork from the original project "https://github.com/lpedebos/pyspark_multiple_db_query" but with a added gui to better usage on remote server.

Now all the steps can be done on the interface.

## Steps to use

1 - Download the code;\
2 - Install the dependencies (a file with them will be added in the future);\
3 - Run "streamlit run streamlit_app.py". This will open a local server. you can access it through the browser on port 8502;\
4 - Login with default credentials;\
5 - Use the lateral menu to go through every step.

## To do

1 - add other databases support;
2 - add database configuration screen;
3 - add multi-thread for database queries (right now the query on databases is sequential).
